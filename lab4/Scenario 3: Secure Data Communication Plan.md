# Scenario 3: Secure Data Communication Plan

- Participants will develop a strategy for securing data storage and transmissions, integrating encryption and secure communication protocols.
- This task will include planning the application of HTTPS and TLS configurations to protect data integrity and confidentiality.

```
PLAN secureDataCommunication:
  IMPLEMENT SSL/TLS for all data in transit
  USE encrypted storage solutions for data at rest
  ENSURE all data exchanges comply with HTTPS protocols
```

In order to have an effective data storage system we could follow the following steps:
- **Store data in encrypted databases.** Make use of the functionalities provided by relational databases and not sql, they are safe mechanisms that allow us to have the tranquility that we do not expose the assets of the company, such as its data and those of its customers.
- **Use utilities that automatically manage the encryption and decryption of the relevant system keys.** This will allow us to avoid human errors in key management, as well as facilitate the automation of these key elements. An example of this would be to use AWS KMS (Key Management Service).
- **Define a secure data transmission channel.** Avoiding attacks when listening to the flow of information on the Internet is of vital importance, because there are mechanisms by which the attacker is listening to sensitive information and this generates vulnerabilities within the application. That is why it is important to implement mechanisms such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- If the communication is through the HTTP protocol, it is necessary to establish a secure communication channel, using HTTPS, which already provides all the necessary mechanisms to have a secure communication channel, as well as to use the best practices and avoid vulnerabilities by updating these mechanisms periodically.
